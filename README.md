## Î™nstructions

If you like the theme and you want to use it "as is", git clone this repo and delete all the production files. Make a new zip folder and upload it to your server theme folder.

The production files are:
- sass folder
- package.json
- gulpfile.js
- README.md
- .gitignore
- .jscsrc
- .jshintignore

To develop and create your own theme follow these steps.

### 1. Git clone
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/marioyiann/pluslife.git
```

### 2. Install node modules
Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 

```sh
$ npm install
```

### 3. Make sure you are running a local server (MAMP, XAMPP, etc).

### 4. Run Gulp
```sh
$ gulp
```

### 5. Start editing

> **Note:** In gulpfile.js the proxy url is "localhost/pluslife/". If you name your project differently, don't forget to change the "pluslife" to your folder name.

#### Folder Structure
If you are familiar with underscores.me template, it will be easy to understand the folder structure.

My additions are:

In root folder:
- fonts
- img
- template-page

In sass folder:
- custom
- vendors

In js folder: 
- assets
- custom

> **Note:** If you choose to develop this theme with npm install, a new folder it will be created with all the node_modules files.
